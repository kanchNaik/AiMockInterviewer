For example, if you want a model that catches almost all spam (high recall), the precision might drop (more false positives). The curve helps you find a good balance.\n\n3. **Optimize Model Performance**: By looking at the curve, you can choose the best threshold that balances precision and recall for your specific needs. For example, in medical tests, you might want high recall to catch as many diseases as possible, even if it means more false alarms.\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe **Precision-Recall Curve** is a visual tool that helps you understand how well a model identifies the positive cases (like spam or a disease) and balances making correct predictions with avoiding false positives, especially in situations where one class is much rarer than the other.\n\n![Precision-Recall Curve](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/satishgunjal/images/6637418f75e7387d8185cc57fde5dd72bc49b7cc/Precision%20Recall%20Curve.png)\n\n# What is TF-IDF?\n**TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** is a method used in text analysis to determine how important a word is in a specific document compared to a whole collection of documents (called a corpus). It helps in identifying words that are most relevant to the content of a document.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n\n1. **Term Frequency (TF)**:\n   - This measures how often a word appears in a document. A higher term frequency means that the word is more significant within that document.\n   - **Simple Example**: If the word \"cat\" appears 3 times in a document with 100 words, the term frequency for \"cat\" is 3/100 = 0.03.\n\n2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**:\n   - This measures how rare or unique a word is across all documents in the corpus. A word that appears in many documents will have a low IDF, while a word that appears in only a few documents will have a high IDF.\n   - **Simple Example**: If the word \"cat\" appears in only 1 out of 100 documents, its IDF is higher because it\u2019s less common across the corpus.\n\n3. **TF-IDF Score**:\n   - This is the combination of TF and IDF. It gives a score that indicates how important a word is in a document, adjusted for how common it is across the entire corpus.\n   - Words that are frequently used in a document but are rare in other documents get higher scores, highlighting their importance for that specific document.\n\n### Why TF-IDF is Useful:\n- **Identifies Key Terms**: TF-IDF helps in identifying the most important words in a document, which are often key topics or themes.\n- **Improves Search Results**: In search engines, TF-IDF can be used to rank documents based on their relevance to a user's query by focusing on unique and significant words.\n- **Text Classification and Clustering**: It helps in categorizing or grouping documents by identifying unique terms that define different categories.\n\n### In Simple Terms:\nTF-IDF helps find words that are important in a document but not too common across other documents. It\u2019s a tool to highlight what makes a document unique, which is useful for search engines, text analysis, and understanding the content better.\n\n# Python or R- which one would you prefer for text analytics?\nWe will prefer python for following reasons\n* We can use pandas library which has easy to use data structures and  high performance data analysis tools\n* R is more suitable for ML than text analytics\n* Python is faster for all types of text analytics."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great job!

This change can lead to a decrease in the performance of machine learning models because the model is no longer receiving the same kind of data it was trained on.\n\n### Key Points to Explain Data Drift:\n\n1. **Definition of Data Drift**:\n   - **Data drift** refers to any change in the distribution of data that a machine learning model was trained on compared to the data it encounters in production. This can cause the model to make inaccurate predictions or classifications because it relies on patterns that may no longer be relevant.\n\n2. **Types of Data Drift**:\n   - **Covariate Drift**: This occurs when the distribution of the input features (independent variables) changes. For example, if a model is predicting sales based on weather data, and there is a shift in climate patterns, the relationship between weather and sales could change.\n   - **Prior Probability Shift**: This type of drift happens when the distribution of the target variable (dependent variable) changes. For instance, in a spam detection model, if the proportion of spam emails decreases over time, the model might need adjustment.\n   - **Concept Drift**: This happens when the relationship between the input features and the target variable changes. For example, a model predicting credit card fraud may experience concept drift if fraudsters change their tactics over time.\n\n3. **Why Data Drift is a Problem**:\n   - **Decreased Model Accuracy**: Models trained on historical data may perform poorly on new data that has drifted. This can lead to incorrect predictions and reduced effectiveness of the model.\n   - **Impact on Business Decisions**: In many applications, such as finance, healthcare, and marketing, decisions based on outdated models can lead to significant financial loss, poor customer experiences, or even safety issues.\n\n4. **Detecting Data Drift**:\n   - **Statistical Tests**: Techniques such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Chi-square test, or Jensen-Shannon divergence can be used to detect changes in data distributions.\n   - **Monitoring Performance Metrics**: Regularly tracking model performance metrics (like accuracy, precision, recall) over time can indicate data drift if there\u2019s a consistent decline.\n   - **Data Visualization**: Visual methods such as histograms, scatter plots, or density plots can help visualize changes in data distributions over time.\n\n5. **Mitigating Data Drift**:\n   - **Regular Model Retraining**: Regularly retraining models with new data helps to ensure they stay up-to-date with the latest trends and patterns.\n   - **Continuous Monitoring**: Implementing systems to continuously monitor incoming data and model performance allows for early detection of drift.\n   - **Adaptive Learning**: Techniques like online learning or incremental learning can help models adapt to changes by learning from new data as it becomes available.\n   - **Feature Engineering Updates**: Revisiting and potentially redefining features to align with the new data distributions can help in maintaining model accuracy.\n\n### Real-World Example of Data Drift:\n\nImagine a retail company that uses a machine learning model to predict customer preferences and recommend products. The model was trained using data collected over the past year. However, due to a sudden change in customer behavior (perhaps driven by a new trend or economic conditions), the products customers are interested in change. This change leads to data drift because the model's predictions are based on outdated information about customer preferences, causing it to recommend less relevant products and reducing the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nData drift is a critical issue in maintaining the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models. Regular monitoring, retraining, and adaptation strategies are essential to ensure models remain effective as real-world conditions change.\n\n# Explain transformer architecture\n\nThe Transformer architecture is a neural network model designed for natural language processing tasks, like translation, summarization, and text generation. It was introduced in the paper \"Attention is All You Need\" by Google in 2017 and has since become the foundation for many advanced NLP models, including BERT and GPT.\n\nKey Components of the Transformer:\n\n**1. Self-Attention Mechanism:**\n\nThe core innovation of the Transformer is its self-attention mechanism. This mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of each word in a sentence relative to every other word when generating a representation. For example, in the sentence \"She saw a dog in the park,\" the word \"she\" has a different relation to \"saw\" than \"dog\" or \"park.\" Self-attention helps the model understand these relationships dynamically.\n\n**2. Multi-Head Attention:**\n\nMulti-head attention enables the model to learn different aspects of word relationships simultaneously by using multiple \"attention heads.\" Each head learns a unique representation of the sentence, which, when combined, provides a more comprehensive understanding.\n\n**3. Positional Encoding:**\n\nSince the Transformer processes all words in parallel (not sequentially), it uses positional encoding to inject information about the position of words into their embeddings. This ensures the model understands the order of words, which is crucial for meaning.\n\n**4. Feed-Forward Neural Networks:**\n\nEach layer in the Transformer also includes a feed-forward neural network that processes the attention outputs to create more complex representations of the input data.\n\n**5. Stacked Layers:**\n\nThe Transformer is composed of several layers of these attention and feed-forward modules. The stacking allows the model to learn increasingly abstract and complex features at each layer.\n\n**Advantages of the Transformer:**\n* Parallelization: Unlike older models like RNNs, Transformers can process all words in a sentence simultaneously. This makes training much faster and more scalable, especially with large datasets.\n* Long-Range Dependency Handling: Transformers excel at capturing relationships between distant words in a sentence, which is essential for understanding context in lengthy texts.\n\n**Why Transformers Are Important:**\nThe ability of Transformers to handle context and relationships in a sentence far surpasses previous models, making them ideal for a wide range of NLP tasks. Their architecture has become the standard in the field, driving innovations in machine translation, text summarization, and language understanding.\n\n# Explain the difference between prediction and forecasting\n\n* If you think of it like a detective story, prediction is about figuring out who committed the crime based on the evidence. It could be something that happened in the past. \n* Forecasting is more like trying to prevent a crime before it happens. We look for patterns and clues to anticipate what might occur in the future.\n\n* In the context of my work with time series models, prediction might be used to identify any current anomalies or issues in our system based on the data we're receiving. Forecasting, however, is where we really leverage the power of time series. By analyzing past trends, we can forecast future system loads and proactively scale our resources to avoid any disruptions.\n\n* The main difference is the time element. Forecasting is always about the future, while prediction can be about any point in time. Also, forecasting usually involves time-series data, where we track something over time, like sales figures or stock prices.\n\n# References\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6QWYwOvJs0&t=1149s\n* https://towardsdatascience.com/taking-the-confusion-out-of-confusion-matrices-c1ce054b3d3e\n* https://kambria.io/blog/confused-about-the-confusion-matrix-learn-all-about-it/#:~:text=Confusion%20matrices%20are%20used%20to,True%20Negatives%20and%20False%20Negatives.\n* https://projects.uplevel.work/insights/confusion-matrix-accuracy-sensitivity-specificity-precision-f1-score-how-to-interpret\n* https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/04/confusion-matrix-machine-learning/\n* https://towardsdatascience.com/imbalanced-classification-in-python-smote-enn-method-db5db06b8d50#:~:text=The%20Concept%3A%20Edited%20Nearest%20Neighbor,the%20observation's%20class%20or%20not.\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aarb0_Cw_48&ab_channel=JayFeng"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great job!

This typically occurs because the selection criteria for respondents failed to capture a wide enough sampling frame to represent all viewpoints.\n\nThe cause of sampling bias almost always owes to one of two conditions.\n1. Poor methodology: In most cases, non-representative samples pop up when researchers set improper parameters for survey research. The most accurate and repeatable sampling method is simple random sampling where a large number of respondents are chosen at random. When researchers stray from random sampling (also called probability sampling), they risk injecting their own selection bias into recruiting respondents.\n\n2. Poor execution: Sometimes data researchers craft scientifically sound sampling methods, but their work is undermined when field workers cut corners. By reverting to convenience sampling (where the only people studied are those who are easy to reach) or giving up on reaching non-responders, a field worker can jeopardize the careful methodology set up by data scientists.\n\nThe best way to avoid sampling bias is to stick to probability-based sampling methods. These include simple random sampling, systematic sampling, cluster sampling, and stratified sampling. In these methodologies, respondents are only chosen through processes of random selection\u2014even if they are sometimes sorted into demographic groups along the way.\n![Alt_text](https://github.com/youssefHosni/Data-Science-Interview-Questions/blob/main/Figures/Sampling%20bias.png)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your answer is comprehensive and demonstrates a good understanding of selection bias, its causes, and how to avoid it.

After these values are selected, grid search then evaluates the algorithm using each and every combination of hyper-parameters and returns the combination that gives the optimal result (i.e. lowest MAE). Because grid search evaluates the given algorithm using all combinations, it's easy to see that this can be quite computationally expensive and can lead to sub-optimal results specifically since the user needs to specify specific values for these hyper-parameters, which is prone for error and requires domain knowledge. * Random Search is similar to grid search but differs in the sense that rather than specifying which values to try for each hyper-parameter, an upper and lower bound of values for each hyper-parameter is given instead. With uniform probability, random values within these bounds are then chosen and similarly, the best combination is returned to the user. Although this seems less intuitive, no domain knowledge is necessary and theoretically much more of the parameter space can be explored. * In a completely different framework, Bayesian Optimization is thought of as a more statistical way of optimization and is commonly used when using neural networks, specifically since one evaluation of a neural network can be computationally costly. In numerous research papers, this method heavily outperforms Grid Search and Random Search and is currently used on the Google Cloud Platform as well as AWS. Because an in-depth explanation requires a heavy background in bayesian statistics and gaussian processes (and maybe even some game theory), a \"\"simple\"\" explanation is that a much simpler/faster acquisition function intelligently chooses (using a surrogate function such as probability of improvement or GP-UCB) which hyper-parameter values to try on the computationally expensive, original algorithm. Using the result of the initial combination of values on the expensive/original function, the acquisition function takes the result of the expensive/original algorithm into account and uses it as its prior knowledge to again come up with another set of hyper-parameters to choose during the next iteration. This process continues either for a specified number of iterations or for a specified amount of time and similarly the combination of hyper-parameters that performs the best on the expensive/original algorithm is chosen.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While it's true that randomly selecting splits and choosing the best one among them can sometimes lead to a decent result, it's not a reliable or efficient approach for finding the optimal split in Data Science.

Hamming Loss: Hamming Loss is the fraction of labels that are incorrectly predicted. It is defined as the average number of labels that are predicted incorrectly per instance.\n\n2.

You cannot directly average the standard deviations. You need to take into account the variance (the square of the standard deviation), the number of elements in each subset, and the mean of each subset. The formula for the pooled standard deviation is sqrt(((n1-1)*stddev1^2 + (n2-1)*stddev2^2 + ... + (nk-1)*stddevk^2) / (n1 + n2 + ... + nk - K)). \n\n Your answer is correct and well explained for the most part.

In other words, activation functions are what make a linear regression model different from a neural network. We need non-linearity, to capture more complex features and model more complex variations that simple linear models can not capture.\n\nThere are a lot of activation functions:\n\n* Sigmoid function: f(x) = 1/(1+exp(-x))\n\nThe output value of it is between 0 and 1, we can use it for classification.

Each convolutional layer is followed by a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) layer or other activation function, then a pooling layer*, then one or more convolutional layers (+ReLU), then another pooling layer.\n\nThe output from each convolution layer is a set of objects called feature maps, generated by a single kernel filter. The feature maps are used to define a new input to the next layer. A common trend is to keep on increasing the number of filters as the size of the image keeps dropping as it passes through the Convolutional and Pooling layers. The size of each kernel filter is usually 3\u00d73 kernel because it can extract the same features which extract from large kernels and faster than them.\n\nAfter that, the final small image with a large number of filters(which is a 3D output from the above layers) is flattened and passed through fully connected layers. At last, we use a softmax layer with the required number of nodes for classification or use the output of the fully connected layers for some other purpose depending on the task.\n\nThe number of these layers can increase depending on the complexity of the data and when they increase you need more data. Stride, Padding, Filter size, Type of Pooling, etc all are Hyperparameters and need to be chosen (maybe based on some previously built successful models)\n\n*Pooling: it is a way to reduce the number of features by choosing a number to represent its neighbor.

If we have a huge size of the dataset, then loading the whole data into memory will reduce the training speed, hence batch term is introduced.\n\nExample: image data contains 1,00,000 images, we can load this into 3125 batches where 1 batch = 32 images. So instead of loading the whole 1,00,000 images in memory, we can load 32 images 3125 times which requires less memory.\n\nIn summary, a batch is important in two ways: (1) Efficient memory consumption. (2) Improve training speed.\n\nThere are 3 types of gradient descent algorithms based on batch size: (1) Stochastic gradient descent (2) Batch gradient descent (3) Mini Batch gradient descent\n\nIf the whole data is in a single batch, it is called batch gradient descent. If the single data points are equal to one batch i.e. number of batches = number of data instances, it is called stochastic gradient descent.

It is used to estimate the precision or accuracy of a sample statistic, such as a mean or a proportion, based on a sample from a larger population.\n\nFor example, if we want to estimate the average height of all adults in a certain region, we can take a random sample of individuals from that region and calculate the sample mean height. Then we can construct a confidence interval for the true population mean height, based on the sample mean and the sample size, with a certain level of confidence, such as 95%. This means that if we repeat the sampling process many times, 95% of the resulting intervals will contain the true population mean height.\n\nThe formula for a confidence interval is:\nconfidence interval = sample statistic +/- margin of error\n\nThe margin of error depends on the sample size, the standard deviation of the population (or the sample, if the population standard deviation is unknown), and the desired level of confidence. For example, if the sample size is larger or the standard deviation is smaller, the margin of error will be smaller, resulting in a narrower confidence interval.\n\nA prediction interval is a range of values that is likely to contain a future observation or outcome with a certain level of confidence. It is used to estimate the uncertainty or variability of a future value based on a statistical model and the observed data.\n\nFor example, if we have a regression model that predicts the sales of a product based on its price and advertising budget, we can use a prediction interval to estimate the range of possible sales for a new product with a certain price and advertising budget, with a certain level of confidence, such as 95%. This means that if we repeat the prediction process many times, 95% of the resulting intervals will contain the true sales value.\n\nThe formula for a prediction interval is:\nprediction interval = point estimate +/- margin of error\n\nThe point estimate is the predicted value of the outcome variable based on the model and the input variables. The margin of error depends on the residual standard deviation of the model, which measures the variability of the observed data around the predicted values, and the desired level of confidence. For example, if the residual standard deviation is larger or the level of confidence is higher, the margin of error will be larger, resulting in a wider prediction interval.\n![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72076328/227254955-b57bd42a-b51b-4b4a-abab-1adb059eca98.png)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your answer is very detailed and accurate.

So in other words you aim to statistically estimate the impact of a given change within your digital product (for example). You measure success and counter metrics on at least 1 treatment vs 1 control group (there can be more than 1 XP group for multivariate tests).\n\nApplications:\n1. Consider the example of a general store that sells bread packets but not butter, for a year. If we want to check whether its sale depends on the butter or not, then suppose the store also sells butter and sales for next year are observed. Now we can determine whether selling butter can significantly increase/decrease or doesn't affect the sale of bread.\n\n2. While developing the landing page of a website you create 2 different versions of the page. You define a criteria for success eg. conversion rate. Then define your hypothesis\nNull hypothesis(H): No difference between the performance of the 2 versions. Alternative hypothesis(H'): version A will perform better than B.\n\nNOTE: You will have to split your traffic randomly(to avoid sample bias) into 2 versions. The split doesn't have to be symmetric, you just need to set the minimum sample size for each version to avoid undersample bias.\n\nNow if version A gives better results than version B, we will still have to statistically prove that results derived from our sample represent the entire population. Now one of the very common tests used to do so is 2 sample t-test where we use values of significance level (alpha) and p-value to see which hypothesis is right. If p-value<alpha, H is rejected.\n\n\nCommon pitfalls:\n\n1. Wrong success metrics inadequate to the business problem\n2. Lack of counter metric, as you might add friction to the product regardless along with the positive impact\n3. Sample mismatch: heterogeneous control and treatment, unequal variances\n4.

The general idea of most boosting methods is to train predictors sequentially, each trying to correct its predecessor.\n\nThere are many boosting methods available, but by far the most popular are: \n\n* Adaptive Boosting: One way for a new predictor to correct its predecessor is to pay a bit more attention to the training instances that the predecessor under-fitted. This results in new predictors focusing more and more on the hard cases.\n* Gradient Boosting:  Another very popular Boosting algorithm is Gradient Boosting. Just like AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting works by sequentially adding predictors to an ensemble, each one correcting its predecessor. However, instead of tweaking the instance weights at every iteration as AdaBoost does, this method tries to fit the new predictor to the residual errors made by the previous predictor.\n\n![1661788022018](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72076328/187241588-6cc3166f-a3e0-46b9-a0ce-e3d9ef9f0228.jpg)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your answer is well-structured and you've done a great job explaining the concept of boosting in machine learning, as well as the two main boosting methods - Adaptive Boosting and Gradient Boosting.

( It means it includes the effect of outliers in scaling process)\n\n**Normalization**\n\n* **What it does:** \n    * Scales the data to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1\n* **Transformation:**\n    * `X_norm = (X - X_min) / (X_max - X_min)`\n* **When to use it:**\n    * Algorithms that rely on distance calculations (e.g., k-nearest neighbors, k-means clustering).\n    * When you don't know the distribution of your data.\n    * When you want to avoid outliers having a disproportionate impact on the scaling.( It means it tries to limit the impact of outliers on scaling process)\n\n**Key differences in a nutshell:**\n\n* **Transformation:** Standardization uses mean and standard deviation. Normalization uses minimum and maximum values.\n* **Distribution Assumption:** Standardization often assumes a normal distribution. Normalization makes no assumptions about the distribution.\n* **Outlier Sensitivity:** Standardization is less sensitive to outliers. Normalization is more sensitive to outliers.\n* **Range:** Standardization has no fixed range. Normalization scales to a specific range (usually 0 to 1).\n\n**Choosing the right one:**\n\n* **No one-size-fits-all answer:** The best choice depends on your specific data, algorithm, and problem. \n* **Experimentation is key:** Try both techniques and compare the results to see which one works better for your particular case.\n\n# What is meant by Data Leakage?\n* Data Leakage is the scenario where the Machine Learning Model is already aware of some part of test data after training.This causes the problem of overfitting.\n* In Machine learning, Data Leakage refers to a mistake that is made by the creator of a machine learning model in which they accidentally share the information between the test and training data sets.\n* Data leakage is a serious and widespread problem in data mining and machine learning which needs to be handled well to obtain a robust and generalized predictive model.\n\n**Examples of data leakage**\n* The most obvious and easy-to-understand cause of data leakage is to include the target variable as a feature. What happens is that after including the target variable as a feature, our purpose of prediction got destroyed. This is likely to be done by mistake but while modelling any ML model, you have to make sure that the target variable is differentiated from the set of features.\n* Another common cause of data leakage is to include test data with training data.\n\n> Above two cases are not very likely to occur because they can easily be spotted while doing the modelling. Below are few data leakage examples that are hard to troubleshoot.\n\n* Presence of Giveaway features\n    * Let\u2019s we are working on a problem statement in which we have to build a model that predicts a certain medical condition. If we have a feature that indicates whether a patient had a surgery related to that medical condition, then it causes data leakage and we should never be included that as a feature in the training data. The indication of surgery is highly predictive of the medical condition and would probably not be available in all cases. If we already know that a patient had a surgery related to a medical condition, then we may not even require a predictive model to start with.\n    * Let\u2019s we are working on a problem statement in which we have to build a model that predicts if a user will stay on a website. Including features that expose the information about future visits will cause the problem of data leakage. So, we have to use only features about the current session because information about the future sessions is not generally available after we deployed our model.\n\n* Leakage during Data preprocessing\n\n* While solving a Machine learning problem statement, firstly we do the data cleaning and preprocessing which involves the following steps:\n\n* Evaluating the parameters for normalizing or rescaling features\n       * Finding the minimum and maximum values of a particular feature\n       * Normalize the particular feature in our dataset\n       * Removing the outliers\n       * Fill or completely remove the missing data in our dataset\n\n* The above-described steps should be done using only the training set. If we use the entire dataset to perform these operations, data leakage may occur. \n    * Applying preprocessing techniques to the entire dataset will cause the model to learn not only the training set but also the test set. As we all know that the test set should be new and previously unseen for any model.\n\n* Reference: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/07/data-leakage-and-its-effect-on-the-performance-of-an-ml-model/#:~:text=How%20does%20it%20exactly%20happen,\u201cleakage\u201d%20instead%20of%20cheating.\n\n# How to detect Data Leakage?\n* Results are too good too true\n    * In general, if we see that the model which we build is too good to be true (i.,e gives predicted and actual output the same), then we should get suspicious and data leakage cannot be ruled out.\n    * At that time, the model might be somehow memorizing the relations between feature and target instead of learning and generalizing it for the unseen data. \n    * So, it is advised that before the testing, the prior documented results are weighed against the expected results.\n* Using EDA\n    * While doing the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we may detect features that are very highly correlated with the target variable. Of course, some features are more correlated than others but a surprisingly high correlation needs to be checked and handled carefully. \n    * We should pay close attention to those features. So, with the help of EDA, we can examine the raw data through statistical and visualization tools.\n* High weight features\n    * After the completion of the model training, if features are having very high weights, then we should pay close attention. Those features might be leaky.\n    \n* Reference: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/07/data-leakage-and-its-effect-on-the-performance-of-an-ml-model/#:~:text=How%20does%20it%20exactly%20happen,\u201cleakage\u201d%20instead%20of%20cheating.\n\n# How to fix the problem of Data Leakage?\nThe main culprit behind this is the way we split our dataset and when. The following steps can prove to be very crucial in preventing data leakage:\n* Select the features such a way that they do not contain information about the target variable, which is not naturally available at the time of prediction.\n* Create a Separate Validation Set\n    * To minimize or avoid the problem of data leakage, we should try to set aside a validation set in addition to training and test sets if possible. \n    * The purpose of the validation set is to mimic the real-life scenario and can be used as a final step. \n    * By doing this type of activity, we will identify if there is any possible case of overfitting which in turn can act as a caution warning against deploying models that are expected to underperform in the production environment.\n* Apply Data preprocessing Separately to both Train and Test subsets\n    * While dealing with neural networks, it is a common practice that we normalize our input data firstly before feeding it into the model. \n    * Generally, data normalization is done by dividing the data by its mean value. More often than not, this normalization is applied to the overall data set, which influences the training set from the information of the test set and eventually it results in data leakage. \n    * Hence, to avoid data leakage, we have to apply any normalization technique separately to both training and test subsets.\n* Problem with the Time-Series Type of data\n    * When dealing with time-series data, we should pay more attention to data leakage. For example, if we somehow use data from the future when doing computations for current features or predictions, it is highly likely to end up with a leaked model. \n    * It generally happens when the data is randomly split into train and test subsets. \n    * So, when working with time-series data, we put a cutoff value on time which might be very useful, as it prevents us from getting any information after the time of prediction.\n    \n**Target Leakage:** This happens when predictors (features) include information that's only available after the target variable is known.\n\n**Example:** Predicting customer churn based on whether they canceled their subscription. The act of canceling is only known after they've churned, making it a leaky predictor.\n    \n* Reference: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/07/data-leakage-and-its-effect-on-the-performance-of-an-ml-model/#:~:text=How%20does%20it%20exactly%20happen,\u201cleakage\u201d%20instead%20of%20cheating.\n\n# What is selection bias?\n* Selection bias is the bias introduced by the selection of individuals, groups, or data for analysis in such a way that proper randomization is not achieved, thereby ensuring that the sample obtained is not representative of the population intended to be analyzed. It is sometimes referred to as the **selection effect**.\n* **Sampling bias** is usually classified as a subtype of selection bias, sampling bias is a bias in which a sample is collected in such a way that some members of the intended population have a lower or higher sampling probability than others.\n* Due to sampling bias, the probability distribution in the collected dataset deviates from its true natural distribution, which may affect ML models performance.\n\n# Difference between supervised and unsupervised learning\n|Supervised|Unsupervised|\n|:-|:-|\n|Used for prediction|Used for analysis|\n|Labelled input data|Unlabelled input data|\n|Data need to be splitted into train/validation/test sets|No split required|\n|Used in Classification and Regression|Used for clustering, dimension reduction & density estimation|\n\n# Explain normal distribution of data\nData can be distributed (spread out) in different ways,\n* It can be spread out more on the left (Left skew)\n\n![](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/images/normal-distribution-skew-left.gif)\n* More on the right (Right Skew)\n\n![](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/images/normal-distribution-skew-right.gif)\n* It can be all jumbled up\n\n![](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/images/normal-distribution-random.gif)\n\n* But there are many cases where the data tends to be around a central value with no bias left or right, and it gets close to a \"Normal Distribution\" like this:\n\n![](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/images/normal-distribution-1.svg)\n\n* The Normal Distribution has:\n    - mean = median = mode\n    - symmetry about the center\n    - 50% of values less than the mean and 50% greater than the mean\n\nReference: https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-normal-distribution.html\n\n# What does it mean when distribution is left skew or right skew?\nIn a **right-skewed** distribution, the tail on the right side is longer.  This means most of the data is clustered on the left, with a few unusually large values pulling the average higher. Think of income distribution - most people earn less, but a few very high earners skew the average upwards.\n\nIn a **left-skewed** distribution, the tail on the left side is longer. This means most of the data is clustered on the right, with a few unusually small values pulling the average lower. An example could be exam scores where most students do well, but a few low scores bring down the average.\n\n# What does the distribution looks like for the average time spend watching youtube per day?\nThe distribution of average time spent watching YouTube per day is likely to be right-skewed.\n\nThis means that most people watch YouTube for a relatively short amount of time each day, while a smaller number of users watch for much longer durations. The tail of the distribution extends to the right, indicating the presence of these high-usage viewers\n\n# Expalin covariance and correlation\n* Covariance and Correlation are two mathematical concepts which are commonly used in the field of probability and statistics. Both concepts describe the relationship between two variables.\n* \u201cCovariance\u201d indicates the **direction of the linear relationship between variables**. \u201cCorrelation\u201d on the other hand measures both the **strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables**.\n* In case of High correlation, two sets of data are strongly linked together \n    - Correlation is Positive when the values increase together, and\n    - Correlation is Negative when one value decreases as the other increases\n    \n    \n   ![](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/images/correlation-examples.svg)\n   \nReference: https://www.mathsisfun.com\n\n# What is regularization. Why it is usefull?\n* Regularization is the process of adding tunning parameter(penalty term) to a model to induce smoothness in order to prevent overfitting.\n* The tunning parameter controls the excessively fluctuating function in such a way that coefficients dont take extreame values.\n* There are two types of regularization as follows:\n    - L1 Regularization or Lasso Regularization.\n    L1 Regularization or Lasso Regularization adds a penalty to the error function. The penalty is the sum of the absolute values of weights.\n    - L2 Regularization or Ridge Regularization.\n    L2 Regularization or Ridge Regularization also adds a penalty to the error function. But the penalty here is the sum of the squared values of weights.\n\n# What are confouding varaiables?\n* In statistics, confounder is a variable that influences both the dependent variable and independent avriable.\n* If you are researeching whether a lack of exercise leads to weight gain. In this case 'lack of exercise' is independent variable and 'weight gain' is dependent variable. A confounding varaible in this case would be 'age' which affect both of these variables.\n\n# Explain ROC curve and AUC\n**ROC Curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)** and **AUC (Area Under the Curve)** are tools used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, particularly when you want to understand how well the model separates two classes, such as \"spam\" and \"not spam.\"\n\n### ROC Curve:\n\n1. **What is the ROC Curve?**\n   - The ROC Curve is a graph that shows the trade-off between the **True Positive Rate (TPR)** and the **False Positive Rate (FPR)** of a model at various thresholds.\n   - **True Positive Rate (TPR)**, also known as **Recall**, tells us how many of the actual positive cases (e.g., actual spam emails) were correctly predicted by the model.\n   - **False Positive Rate (FPR)** tells us how many of the actual negative cases (e.g., non-spam emails) were incorrectly predicted as positive by the model.\n\n2. **How to Read the ROC Curve?**\n   - The **X-axis** represents the False Positive Rate (FPR), and the **Y-axis** represents the True Positive Rate (TPR).\n   - A perfect model would reach the top left corner of the graph (high TPR and low FPR), indicating it correctly identifies all positives and has no false positives.\n\n### AUC (Area Under the Curve):\n\n1. **What is AUC?**\n   - **AUC** stands for **Area Under the ROC Curve**. It provides a single number summary of the ROC Curve, which measures the overall ability of the model to distinguish between positive and negative classes.\n   - **AUC values range from 0 to 1**:\n     - An **AUC of 0.5** means the model performs no better than random guessing.\n     - An **AUC close to 1** means the model has excellent performance, correctly distinguishing between the classes almost all the time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The user's answer is correct.

If we have a store database with a client's data table holding a bunch of demographics, we could self-join the client's table to get clients who are located in the same city/made a purchase on the same day/etc.\n\n2- querying a table that has hierarchical data:\n\nMeaning, the table has a primary key that has a one-to-many relationship with another foreign key inside the same table, in other words, the table has data that refers to the same table. We could use self-join in order to have a clear look at the data by matching its keys.\n\nEx. The organizational structure of a company may contain an employee table that has an employee id and his manager id (who is also an employee, hence has an employee id too) in the same table.

The general idea of gradient descent is to tweak parameters iteratively in order to minimize a cost function.\n\nBatch Gradient Descent:\nIn Batch Gradient descent the whole training data is used to minimize the loss function by taking a step toward the nearest minimum by calculating the gradient (the direction of descent)\n\nPros:\nSince the whole data set is used to calculate the gradient it will be stable and reach the minimum of the cost function without bouncing (if the learning rate is chosen cooreclty)\n\nCons:\n\nSince batch gradient descent uses all the training set to compute the gradient at every step, it will be very slow especially if the size of the training data is large.\n\n\nStochastic Gradient Descent:\n\nStochastic Gradient Descent picks up a random instance in the training data set at every step and computes the gradient based only on that single instance.\n\nPros:\n1. It makes the training much faster as it only works on one instance at a time.\n2. It become easier to train large datasets\n\nCons:\n\nDue to the stochastic (random) nature of this algorithm, this algorithm is much less regular than the batch gradient descent. Instead of gently decreasing until it reaches the minimum, the cost function will bounce up and down, decreasing only on average. Over time it will end up very close to the minimum, but once it gets there it will continue to bounce around, not settling down there. So once the algorithm stops the final parameters are good but not optimal. For this reason, it is important to use a training schedule to overcome this randomness.\n\nMini-batch Gradient:\n\nAt each step instead of computing the gradients on the whole data set as in the Batch Gradient Descent or using one random instance as in the Stochastic Gradient Descent, this algorithm computes the gradients on small random sets of instances called mini-batches.\n\nPros: \n1. The algorithm's progress space is less erratic than with Stochastic Gradient Descent, especially with large mini-batches.\n2. You can get a performance boost from hardware optimization of matrix operations, especially when using GPUs.\n\nCons: \n1. It might be difficult to escape from local minima.\n\n![alt text](https://github.com/youssefHosni/Data-Science-Interview-Questions/blob/main/Figures/gradient%20descent%20vs%20batch%20gradient%20descent.png)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your explanation of the different types of gradient descent is comprehensive and well-structured.

If any of them is violated, model predictions and interpretation may be worthless or misleading. 1. **Linear relationship** between features and target variable. 2. **Additivity** means that the effect of changes in one of the features on the target variable does not depend on values of other features. For example, a model for predicting revenue of a company have of two features - the number of items _a_ sold and the number of items _b_ sold. When company sells more items _a_ the revenue increases and this is independent of the number of items _b_ sold. But, if customers who buy _a_ stop buying _b_, the additivity assumption is violated. 3. Features are not correlated (no **collinearity**) since it can be difficult to separate out the individual effects of collinear features on the target variable. 4. Errors are independently and identically normally distributed (yi = B0 + B1*x1i + ... + errori): 1. No correlation between errors (consecutive errors in the case of time series data). 2. Constant variance of errors - **homoscedasticity**. For example, in case of time series, seasonal patterns can increase errors in seasons with higher activity. 3.

Therefore helps to reduce the number of parameters in the whole system, making it computationally cheap. It basically means that the same parameters will be used to represent different transformations in the system. This basically means the same matrix elements may be updated multiple times during backpropagation from varied gradients. The same set of elements will facilitate transformations at more than one layer instead of those from a single layer as conventional. This is usually done in architectures like Siamese that tend to have parallel trunks trained simultaneously. In that case, using shared weights in a few layers( usually the bottom layers) helps the model converge better. This behavior, as observed, can be attributed to more diverse feature representations learned by the system. Since neurons corresponding to the same features are triggered in varied scenarios. Helps to model to generalize better.\n\n\n\nNote that sometimes the parameter sharing assumption may not make sense. This is especially the case when the input images to a ConvNet have some specific centered structure, where we should expect, for example, that completely different features should be learned on one side of the image than another. \n\nOne practical example is when the input is faces that have been centered in the image.

After these values are selected, grid search then evaluates the algorithm using each and every combination of hyper-parameters and returns the combination that gives the optimal result (i.e. lowest MAE). Because grid search evaluates the given algorithm using all combinations, it's easy to see that this can be quite computationally expensive and can lead to sub-optimal results specifically since the user needs to specify specific values for these hyper-parameters, which is prone for error and requires domain knowledge. * Random Search is similar to grid search but differs in the sense that rather than specifying which values to try for each hyper-parameter, an upper and lower bound of values for each hyper-parameter is given instead. With uniform probability, random values within these bounds are then chosen and similarly, the best combination is returned to the user. Although this seems less intuitive, no domain knowledge is necessary and theoretically much more of the parameter space can be explored. * In a completely different framework, Bayesian Optimization is thought of as a more statistical way of optimization and is commonly used when using neural networks, specifically since one evaluation of a neural network can be computationally costly. In numerous research papers, this method heavily outperforms Grid Search and Random Search and is currently used on the Google Cloud Platform as well as AWS. Because an in-depth explanation requires a heavy background in bayesian statistics and gaussian processes (and maybe even some game theory), a \"\"simple\"\" explanation is that a much simpler/faster acquisition function intelligently chooses (using a surrogate function such as probability of improvement or GP-UCB) which hyper-parameter values to try on the computationally expensive, original algorithm. Using the result of the initial combination of values on the expensive/original function, the acquisition function takes the result of the expensive/original algorithm into account and uses it as its prior knowledge to again come up with another set of hyper-parameters to choose during the next iteration. This process continues either for a specified number of iterations or for a specified amount of time and similarly the combination of hyper-parameters that performs the best on the expensive/original algorithm is chosen.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great job!

Then we can calculate it with the experience of N other users U as r_ui = 1/N * sum(v in U) r_vi. * In order to rate similar experiences with a higher weight, we can introduce a similarity between users that we use as a multiplier for each rating. * Also, as users have an individual profile, one user may have an average rating much larger than another user, so we use normalization techniques (e.g. centering or Z-score normalization) to remove the users' biases. * Collaborative filtering does only need a rating matrix as input and improves over time.

Ale schemas is possible, but frequent changes to the schema for large tables can cause performance issues.  Horizontal scaling is relatively difficult, leading to eventual performance bottlenecks\n\n**Disadvantages of NoSQL Databases:** As outlined by the BASE framework, weaker guarantees of data correctness are made due to the soft-state and eventual consistency property.

In contrast, with permutations, we are considering the specific assignment of each person to a particular birthday, where the order matters because we care about which person gets which birthday. i.e. if Person A is born on 01/01 and person B is born on 02/02, its different than if Person A is born on 02/02 and person B is born on 01/01.\n\n\nInteresting facts provided by Rishi Dey Chowdhury:\n1. With just 23 people there is over 50% chance of a birthday match and with 57 people the match probability exceeds 99%. One intuition to think of why with such a low number of people the probability of a match is so high. It's because for a match we require a pair of people and 23 choose 2 is 23*11 = 253 which is a relatively big number and ya 50% sounds like a decent probability of a match for this case.\n\n2. Another interesting fact is if the assumption of equal probability of birthday of a person on any day out of 365 is violated and there is a non-equal probability of birthday of a person among days of the year then, it is even more likely to have a birthday match.\n![Alt_text](https://github.com/youssefHosni/Data-Science-Interview-Questions/blob/main/Figures/Therotical%20Explanation%20Q%207%20Probability.jfif)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your answer is quite comprehensive and shows a strong understanding of the concept of probability and permutations.

If we want to learn the relationship between these two features, we need to have enough data points so that we can accurately estimate the parameters of that relationship. However, if we add a third feature, x3, then the number of data points required to accurately learn the relationships between all three features increases exponentially. This is because there are now more parameters to estimate, and the number of data points needed to accurately estimate those parameters increases exponentially with the number of parameters. Simply put, the curse of dimensionality basically means that the error increases with the increase in the number of features.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your answer seems to focus on the importance or usefulness of the metric rather than its calculation.

So the following loss functions are used:\n- Gini's Index\nGini impurity is used to predict the likelihood of a randomly chosen example being incorrectly classified by a particular node. It\u2019s referred to as an \u201cimpurity\u201d measure because it demonstrates how the model departs from a simple division.\n\n- Cross-entropy or Information Gain\nInformation gain refers to the process of identifying the most important features/attributes that convey the most information about a class. The entropy principle is followed with the goal of reducing entropy from the root node to the leaf nodes. Information gain is the difference in entropy before and after splitting, which describes the impurity of in-class items.\n\n\nFor regression, the good old mean squared error serves as a good loss function which is minimized by splits of the input features and predicting the mean value of the target feature on the subspaces resulting from the split. But finding the split that results in the minimum possible residual sum of squares is computationally infeasible, so a greedy top-down approach is taken i.e. the splits are made at a level from top to down which results in maximum reduction of RSS. We continue this until some maximum depth or number of leaves is attained."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your answer is comprehensive and shows a good understanding of decision tree algorithms and the various methods to split a tree.

It is a popular approach in deep learning where pre-trained models are used as the starting point for computer vision and natural language processing tasks given the vast computing and time resources required to develop neural network models on these problems and from the huge jumps in a skill that they provide on related problems.\n\nTransfer learning is used for tasks where the data is too little to train a full-scale model from the beginning.

Pre-Processing:**\n\n* Check whether you can get more data or not.\n\n* Use sampling techniques (Sample minority class, Downsample majority class, can take the hybrid approach as well). We can also use data augmentation to add more data points for the minority class but with little deviations/changes leading to new data points that are similar to the ones they are derived from. The most common/popular technique is SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling technique)\n\n* Suppression: Though not recommended, we can drop off some features directly responsible for the imbalance.\n\n* Learning Fair Representation: Projecting the training examples to a subspace or plane minimizes the data imbalance.\n\n* Re-Weighting: We can assign some weights to each training example to reduce the imbalance in the data.\n\n**2. In-Processing:**\n\n* Regularisation: We can add score terms that measure the data imbalance in the loss function and therefore minimizing the loss function will also minimize the degree of imbalance concerning the score chosen which also indirectly minimizes other metrics that measure the degree of data imbalance.\n\n* Adversarial Debiasing: Here we use the adversarial notion to train the model where the discriminator tries to detect if there are signs of data imbalance in the predicted data by the generator and hence the generator learns to generate data that is less prone to imbalance.\n\n**3. Post-Processing:**\n* Odds-Equalization: Here we try to equalize the odds for the classes with respect to the data is imbalanced for correct imbalance in the trained model. Usually, the F1 score is a good choice, if both precision and recall scores are important\n\n* Choose appropriate performance metrics.

It combines three key components: Autoregression (AR), Differencing (I), and Moving Average (MA).\n\n* Autoregression (AR):\nThe autoregressive component captures the relationship between an observation in a time series and a certain number of lagged observations. It assumes that the value at a given time depends linearly on its own previous values. The \"p\" parameter in ARIMA(p, d, q) represents the order of autoregressive terms. For example, ARIMA(1, 0, 0) refers to a model with one autoregressive term.\n\n* Differencing (I):\nDifferencing is used to make a time series stationary by removing trends or seasonality. It calculates the difference between consecutive observations to eliminate any non-stationary behavior. The \"d\" parameter in ARIMA(p, d, q) represents the order of differencing. For instance, ARIMA(0, 1, 0) indicates that differencing is applied once.\n\n* Moving Average (MA):\nThe moving average component takes into account the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations. It assumes that the value at a given time depends linearly on the error terms from previous time steps. The \"q\" parameter in ARIMA(p, d, q) represents the order of the moving average terms. For example, ARIMA(0, 0, 1) signifies a model with one moving average term.\n\nBy combining these three components, the ARIMA model can capture both autoregressive patterns, temporal dependencies, and stationary behavior in a time series. The parameters p, d, and q are typically determined through techniques like the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).\n\nIt's worth noting that there are variations of the ARIMA model, such as SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA), which incorporates additional seasonal components for modeling seasonal patterns in the data.\n\nARIMA models are widely used in forecasting applications, but they do make certain assumptions about the underlying data, such as linearity and stationarity. It's important to validate these assumptions and adjust the model accordingly if they are not met.\n![1-1](https://github.com/youssefHosni/Data-Science-Interview-Questions-Answers/assets/72076328/12707951-bdf5-4cd1-9efd-c60c465007a3)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great job explaining the ARIMA model and its components!

As an added benefit, each of the \u201cnew\u201d variables after PCA are all **independent** of one another\n* Reducing the number of the variables of the datset naturally comes at the expense of accuracy, but the trick in dimensionality reduction is to trade a little accuracy for simplicity.\n* By reducing the dimension of your feature space, you have fewer relationships between variables to consider and you are less likely to overfit your model\n\n### When should I use PCA?\n* Do you want to reduce the number of variables, but aren\u2019t able to identify variables to completely remove from consideration?\n* Do you want to ensure your variables are independent of one another?\n* Are you comfortable making your independent variables less interpretable?\n\n* Reference: https://builtin.com/data-science/step-step-explanation-principal-component-analysis, https://towardsdatascience.com/a-one-stop-shop-for-principal-component-analysis-5582fb7e0a9c\n\n# Explain feature scaling\n* Feature scaling is one of the most important data preprocessing step in machine learning\n* If we are **changing the range of the features then its called 'scaling'** and if we are **changing the distribution of the features then its called 'normalization/standardization'**\n\n## Scaling\n* This means that you're transforming your data so that it fits within a specific scale, like 0-100 or 0-1. By scaling your variables, you can help compare different variables on equal footing.\n* Scaling is required in case of distance based algorithms like support vector machines (SVM) or k-nearest neighbors (KNN).\n* For example, you might be looking at the prices of some products in both Yen and US Dollars. One US Dollar is worth about 100 Yen, but if you don't scale your prices, methods like SVM or KNN will consider a difference in price of 1 Yen as important as a difference of 1 US Dollar! This clearly doesn't fit with our intuitions of the world. With currency, you can convert between currencies.\n* But what about if you're looking at something like height and weight? It's not entirely clear how many pounds should equal one inch (or how many kilograms should equal one meter). For example, if weight ranges from 50 to 100 kilograms and height ranges from 150 to 200 centimeters, the model might give more importance to the weight feature simply because its range is wider. Without scaling, a model might consider a difference of 10 kilograms as equally significant as a difference of 10 centimeters, even though these units measure very different things. This could lead to misleading results because the model's decisions are based on the scale rather than the underlying relationships."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The user's answer is not entirely correct.

The data spanned multiple tables, including patient records, appointment histories, and insurance details, making it a complex task.\n\nAction: I scheduled a meeting with the data analyst to fully understand the intricacies of the business question. We worked together to break down the question into smaller, more manageable parts, such as filtering patient records by insurance type, calculating average wait times, and then joining these insights. I then drafted an SQL query plan that would fetch and aggregate this data. To ensure the query was efficient and wouldn\u2019t overload our systems, I also examined the execution plan and made necessary optimizations. Once I had a working query, I ran it on a smaller subset of the data and reviewed the results with the analyst to make sure it met the requirements.\n\nResult: The data query successfully extracted the information needed to answer the complex business question. It allowed the analyst to discover that patients with a specific type of insurance were, on average, waiting 20% longer than those with other types. These insights were later discussed in a strategic meeting and led to operational changes to address the disparity in wait times.

If the curve is shifted to the left or to the right, it is said to be skewed.Skewness can be quantified as a representation of the extent to which a given distribution varies from a normal distribution. \nThere are two main types of skewness negative skew which refers to a longer or fatter tail on the left side of the distribution, while positive skew refers to a longer or fatter tail on the right. These two skews refer to the direction or weight of the distribution.\n\nThe mean of positively skewed data will be greater than the median. In a negatively skewed distribution, the exact opposite is the case: the mean of negatively skewed data will be less than the median. If the data graphs symmetrically, the distribution has zero skewness, regardless of how long or fat the tails are.\n\nThere are several ways to measure skewness. Pearson\u2019s first and second coefficients of skewness are two common methods. Pearson\u2019s first coefficient of skewness, or Pearson mode skewness, subtracts the mode from the mean and divides the difference by the standard deviation. Pearson\u2019s second coefficient of skewness, or Pearson median skewness, subtracts the median from the mean, multiplies the difference by three, and divides the product by the standard deviation.\n\n![1663943424873](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72076328/191984720-5b267ab0-9ed3-4315-8443-62d662822796.jpg)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your answer is very detailed and thorough.

It is an ensemble learning approach used to improve the stability and accuracy of machine learning algorithms.\n* Since multiple model predictions are averaged together to form the final predictions, Bagging reduces variance and helps to avoid overfitting. Although it is usually applied to decision tree methods, it can be used with any type of method.\n* Bagging is a special case of the model averaging approach, in case of regression problem we take mean of the output and in case of classification we take the majority vote.\n* Bagging is more helpfull if we have over fitting (high variance) base models.\n* We can also build independent estimators of same type on each subset. These independent estimators also enable us to parallelly process and increase the speed.\n* Most popular bagging estimator is 'Bagging Tress' also knows as 'Random Forest'\n\n## Bootstrapping\n\n* It is a resampling technique, where large numbers of smaller samples of the same size are repeatedly drawn, with replacement, from a single original sample.\n* So this technique will enable us to produce as many subsample as we required from the original training data.\n* The defination is simple to understand, but \"replacement\" word may be confusing sometimes. Here 'replacement' word signifies that the same obervation may repeat more than once in a given sample, and hence this technique is also known as **sampleing with replacement**\n\n![Bootstrap_Sampling_ML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/satishgunjal/images/master/Bootstrap_Sampling_ML.png)\n\n* As you can see in above image we have training data with observations from X1 to X10. In first bootstrap training sample X6, X10 and X2 are repeated where as in second training sample X3, X4, X7 and X9 are repeated.\n* Bootstrap sampling helps us to generate random sample from given training data for each model in order to genralise the final estimation.\n* So in case of Bagging we create multiple number of bootstrap samples from given data to train our base models. Each sample will contain training and test data sets which are different from each other and remember that training sample may contain duplicate observations.\n\n# What is Out-of-Bag Error in Random Forests?\n* Out-of-Bag is equivalent to validation or test data but it is calculated internally by Random Forest algorithm. In case of Sklearn if we set hyperparameter 'oob_score =  True' then Out-of-Bag score will be calculated for every decision tree.\n* Finally, we aggregate all the errors from all the decision trees and we will determine the overall OOB error rate for the classification.\n* For more details refer. https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-out-of-bag-oob-score-in-random-forest-a7fa23d710\n\n# What is the use of proximity matrix in the random forest algorithm?\nA proximity matrix is used for the following cases :\n* Missing value imputation\n* Detection of outliers\n\n# List down the parameters used to fine-tune the Random Forest.\nTwo parameters that have to fine-tune to improve the predictions that are important in the random forest algorithm are as follows:\n* Number of trees used in the forest (n_tree)\n* Number of random variables used in each of the trees in the forest (mtry)\n\n# What is K Fold cross validation? Why do you use it?\n* In case of K Fold cross validation input data is divided into \u2018K\u2019 number of folds, hence the name K Fold. Suppose we have divided data into 5 folds i.e. K=5. Now we have 5 sets of data to train and test our model. So the model will get trained and tested 5 times, but for every iteration we will use one fold as test data and rest all as training data. Note that for every iteration, data in training and test fold changes which adds to the effectiveness of this method.\n* This significantly reduces underfitting as we are using most of the data for training(fitting), and also significantly reduces overfitting as most of the data is also being used in validation set.\n* K Fold cross validation helps to generalize the machine learning model, which results in better predictions on unknown data. \n* Reference: [K Fold Cross Validation](https://satishgunjal.com/kfold/)\n\n# How to handle missing data?\nData can be missing because of mannual error or can be gennualy missing.\n\n* Delete low quality records completely which have too much missing data\n* Impute the values by educated guess, taking average or regression\n* Use domain knwledge to impute values"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your answer is quite comprehensive and covers all the important aspects of Bagging.

KPIs provide targets for teams to shoot for, milestones to gauge progress, and insights that help people across the organization make better decisions. From finance and HR to marketing and sales, key performance indicators help every area of the business move forward at the strategic level.\n\nKPIs are an important way to ensure your teams are supporting the overall goals of the organization. Here are some of the biggest reasons why you need key performance indicators.\n\n* Keep your teams aligned: Whether measuring project success or employee performance, KPIs keep teams moving in the same direction.\n* Provide a health check: Key performance indicators give you a realistic look at the health of your organization, from risk factors to financial indicators.\n* Make adjustments: KPIs help you clearly see your successes and failures so you can do more of what\u2019s working, and less of what\u2019s not.\n* Hold your teams accountable: Make sure everyone provides value with key performance indicators that help employees track their progress and help managers move things along.\n\nTypes of KPIs\nKey performance indicators come in many flavors. While some are used to measure monthly progress against a goal, others have a longer-term focus. The one thing all KPIs have in common is that they\u2019re tied to strategic goals. Here\u2019s an overview of some of the most common types of KPIs.\n\n* **Strategic**: These big-picture key performance indicators monitor organizational goals. Executives typically look to one or two strategic KPIs to find out how the organization is doing at any given time. Examples include return on investment, revenue and market share.\n* **Operational:** These KPIs typically measure performance in a shorter time frame, and are focused on organizational processes and efficiencies. Some examples include sales by region, average monthly transportation costs and cost per acquisition (CPA).\n* **Functional Unit:** Many key performance indicators are tied to specific functions, such finance or IT. While IT might track time to resolution or average uptime, finance KPIs track gross profit margin or return on assets. These functional KPIs can also be classified as strategic or operational.\n* **Leading vs Lagging:** Regardless of the type of key performance indicator you define, you should know the difference between leading indicators and lagging indicators. While leading KPIs can help predict outcomes, lagging KPIs track what has already happened. Organizations use a mix of both to ensure they\u2019re tracking what\u2019s most important.\n\n\n![Alt_text](https://github.com/youssefHosni/Data-Science-Interview-Questions/blob/main/Figures/KPI.png)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your answer is very comprehensive and well-structured.

Unlike R-squared, Adjusted R-squared measures variation explained by only the independent variables that actually affect the dependent variable.\n* So the Adjusted R-squre score will increase only if addition of predictors improve the models performance significantly or else it will decrease. Hence correct answer is Adjusted R-squared\n\n* Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRAgottY8XU&list=PLjW9PIyfCennBOprV3CPoqMX8SW-qNlUa\n\n# Suppose we have a function -4x^2 + 4x + 3.

In regression this would result in multicollinearity. We can try methods such as dimension reduction, feature selection, stepwise regression to choose the correct input variables for predictiong Y\n* Second part of question is - should we use all the variables for modeling?\n  - Using multicolnear feature in modeling doesnt help. We should remove all the multicolnear feature and keep unique feature so that explaining the model predictions also becomes easy.\n  - It will also make model less complex and we dont have to store many features.\n\n# What is stepwise regression?\nStepwise regression is a method of fitting regression models in which the choice of predictive variables is carried out by an automatic procedure. In each step, a variable is considered for addition to or subtraction from the set of explanatory variables based on some prespecified criterion.\n\nStepwise regression is classified into backward and forward selection.\n* **Backward selection** starts with a full model, then step by step we reduce the regressor variables and find the model with the least RSS, largest R\u00b2, or the least MSE. The variables to drop would be the ones with high p-values.\n* **Forward selection** starts with a null model, then step by step we increase the regressor variables until we can no longer improve the error performance of the model. We usually pick the model with the highest adjusted R\u00b2.\n\n# You have two buckets - one of 3 liters and other of 5 liters. You are expected to mesure exactly 4 liters.

When training an RNN we do backward propagation both through layers and backward through time. Without focusing too much on mathematics, during backward propagation we tend to multiply gradients that are either > 1 or < 1, if the gradients are < 1 and we have about 100 steps backward in time then multiplying 100 numbers that are < 1 will result in a very very tiny gradient causing no change in the weights as we go backward in time (0.1 * 0.1 * 0.1 * .... a 100 times = 10^(-100)) such that in our previous example the word \"is\" doesn't affect its main dependency the word \"boy\" during learning the meanings of the word due to the long description in between.\n\nModels like the Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and the Long short-term memory (LSTMs) were proposed, the main idea of these models is to use gates to help the network determine which information to keep and which information to discard during learning.

In my previous role, I was handling a project with multiple stakeholders and complex requirements, which made it difficult to meet the tight deadline. To resolve the issue, I immediately called for a team meeting to assess the situation and brainstorm solutions. I also communicated with the client to negotiate a revised deadline, explaining the challenges we were facing. We eventually broke the deliverables into two groups - high-priority tasks which we shared by the original deadline and the low-priority tasks that we could handle at a later date. Through effective collaboration and clear communication, we were able to come to a solution that worked for all stakeholders."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Excellent response!
