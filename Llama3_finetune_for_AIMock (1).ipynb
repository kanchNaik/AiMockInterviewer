But there’s always room for surprise, and sometimes the results are entirely unexpected. This data analyst interview question lets you discuss the analytical projects you’ve been involved in and allows you to demonstrate your excitement about drawing new developments from your projects. And don’t forget to mention the action you and the stakeholders took due to the unexpected outcome. While performing routine customer database analysis, I was astonished to discover a customer subsegment that the company could target with a new suitable product and a relevant message. That presented an excellent opportunity for additional revenue for the company by utilizing a subset of an existing customer base. Everyone on my team was pleasantly surprised, and soon enough, we began devising strategies with Product Development to address the needs of this newly discovered subsegment.\n",

It also assumes that the networks kernels can be reused for all nodes, hence the number of weights can be drastically reduced. To counteract only one feature being learnt per layer, multiple kernels are applied to the input which creates parallel channels in the output. Consecutive layers can also be stacked to allow the network to find more high-level features.\n",

You can use your answer to showcase integrity, selflessness and teamwork. In your answer, describe a situation where you helped others or offered to complete a task or work on a project in addition to completing your regular duties. Last summer, senior executives at H.B. Bank visited our regional office. In preparation, our management asked my team to compile a report that included spreadsheets and a slide presentation to show our performance over the previous 12 months. The week before, the team member we assigned the spreadsheet to became ill and could not complete it. Knowing how important it was, I volunteered to work on the spreadsheet on her behalf, and my completed work impressed the senior management, resulting in my supervisor publicly thanking me for my additional contributions.\n",

If you can fit the bell-shaped \"\"normal\"\" curve to the histogram, then the hypothesis that the underlying random variable follows the normal distribution can not be rejected. 2. Check Skewness and Kurtosis of the sampled data. Skewness = 0 and kurtosis = 3 are typical for a normal distribution, so the farther away they are from these values, the more non-normal the distribution. 3. Use Kolmogorov-Smirnov or/and Shapiro-Wilk tests for normality. They take into account both Skewness and Kurtosis simultaneously. 4. Check for Quantile-Quantile plot. It is a scatterplot created by plotting two sets of quantiles against one another. Normal Q-Q plot place the data points in a roughly straight line.\n",

In an ideal scenario where there is a perfectly separable data, both precision and recall can get maximum value of 1.0. But in most of the practical situations, there is noise in the dataset and the dataset is not perfectly separable. There might be some points of positive class closer to the negative class and vice versa. In such cases, shifting the decision boundary can either increase the precision or recall but not both. Increasing one parameter leads to decreasing of the other.\"\n",

Then we can calculate it with the experience of N other users U as r_ui = 1/N * sum(v in U) r_vi. * In order to rate similar experiences with a higher weight, we can introduce a similarity between users that we use as a multiplier for each rating. * Also, as users have an individual profile, one user may have an average rating much larger than another user, so we use normalization techniques (e.g. centering or Z-score normalization) to remove the users' biases. * Collaborative filtering does only need a rating matrix as input and improves over time. However, it does not work well on sparse data, does not work for cold starts (see below) and usually tends to overfit.\n",

However, because it uses squared differences, the units are squared as well, which can be less intuitive than the standard deviation. Standard deviation is the square root of the variance, bringing the units back to the same as the original data. It provides a more interpretable measure of spread. For example, if the variance of a dataset is 25, the standard deviation is ?25 = 5.\n",
